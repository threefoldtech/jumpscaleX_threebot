## play.grid.tf

The idea is to make it easy for us to deploy new instances for tf-simulator and enhance the user experience for deploying new instances.

### Deploy new container

```bash
curl -X POST play.grid.tf 
Visit your container using this link: http://tf-simulator-90f0d.play.grid.tf, your container will be destroyed after 1 hour
```
